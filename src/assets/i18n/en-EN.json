  "POKEMON_MANAGER": "Pokemon Manager",
  "PM_DESC1": "Pokemon Manager is a personal project that I started in June 2023 with a clear goal: to merge two worlds that I am passionate about, Pokemon and management games in the style of Football Manager.",
  "PM_DESC2": "The idea is simple: instead of experiencing the Pokemon adventure from the traditional third-person perspective, you step into the shoes of a manager. The mission is to ensure the proper development of the Pokémon while keeping an eye on the team's performance.",
  "PM_DESC3": "This project is an opportunity for me to strengthen my skills in Angular, a technology I use in a professional context, while deepening my knowledge of MongoDB, which I discovered during my studies.",
  "WORK_IN_PROGRESS": "Work in progress...",
  "AW_DESC1": "During my internship at Astrée Software, I had the opportunity to contribute, among other projects, to the development of the company's flagship software, Aquiweb.",
  "AW_DESC2": "Aquiweb, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES), digitizes production processes to sustainably optimize industrial performance.",
  "AW_DESC3": "This project at Astrée Software played a crucial role in my professional journey as it was my introduction to the world of software development.",
  "INTRO": "Software Engineering in Apprentiship at Astree Software",
  "D3JS_DESC1": "During my engineering studies, we undertook a project that combined two disciplines: data visualization and scripting language programming.",
  "D3JS_DESC2": "The goal of this project was to explore the D3.js library for data visualization. We focused on electric cars, developing a tool that assists in making informed decisions when purchasing an electric vehicle.",
  "HTML_CSS_BDD_DESC1": "During the web technology course, we carried out a project aimed at establishing a connection between a web page and a database",
  "HTML_CSS_BDD_DESC2": "This project gave me the opportunity to explore new technologies, particularly Docker and PHP.",

  "PORTFOLIO_DESC1": "Through this portfolio project, I have designed and developed a showcase of my skills and projects as a developer. The aim was to create a space that represents me professionally, highlighting my work.",
  "PORTFOLIO_DESC2": "This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, my passion for software development, and my commitment to staying at the forefront of technology in a dynamic professional environment.",
  "BATTLE_DESC1": "In my Pokémon Manager game, I've designed a battle system where two teams of six Pokémon each face off in fully automated duels.",
  "BATTLE_DESC2": "Player involvement lies in the pre-battle strategy: meticulously choosing your team of Pokémon before the battle begins is crucial, as once the fight starts, the course of events is in the hands of your Pokémon.",
  "PC_DESC1": "The storage PC in Pokemon Manager is at the heart of the player's strategic management. Here, one can manage their entire collection of Pokemon, accessing a detailed set of information for each creature.",
  "PC_DESC2": "Players can not only select two attacks from a wide range that each Pokemon is capable of learning, but they can also compose their battle team by choosing which Pokemon will be active for upcoming encounters and which will stay in reserve.",
  "NURSERY_DESC1": "The nursery in Pokemon Manager is currently the only way to expand one's collection of Pokemon. The system allows players to order eggs by specifying the desired type and quantity, depending on the nursery's level of development.",
  "NURSERY_DESC2": "After placing an order, there is a waiting period for incubation before receiving the eggs. Then comes the first selection stage, where players must eliminate half of the eggs, guided solely by an estimate of each egg's hidden potential.",
  "NURSERY_DESC3": "Finally, a final selection phase reveals the type of Pokemon for each remaining egg, allowing for a more refined strategy in shaping one's team.",
  "CALENDAR_DESC1": "The calendar is a central tool, providing an overview of the key events in the game.",
  "CALENDAR_DESC2": "It is designed to indicate the different types of activities: events related to the nursery are marked in green, while those related to battles are in purple.",
  "CALENDAR_DESC3": "This feature allows players to easily navigate through the flow of activities and strategically plan their next actions, taking into account upcoming events in the game world.",
  "POKEDEX_DESC": "The Pokedex provides players with a comprehensive overview of all the Pokemon in the game, making it easier to plan their strategy and discover new species.",
